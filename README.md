**2D square lattice**: This model shows the LA and LO of 2D square lattice crystal.
The single basis is located on top of the lattice point and each atoms in the basis are connect to the nearest atoms
and the next nearest atoms

**Magnetic resonance Rabi oscillation**: This model show the Magnetic resonance of spin 1/2 particle.
2D plot shows the probability of particle be in the spin up state or spin down state.
3D plot shows the 3D plot of expectation value of spin <Sx>, <Sy>, <Sz>.

**Ising model**: The critical temperature of an ising model is 2.7K.
